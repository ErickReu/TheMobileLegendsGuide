		<p> Emblem Set and  Talent system were designed to give you a small additional attributes on your hero and supply an innate effect. They provide older players with a slight advantage against newbie players who just started the game
		</p>

		<p>The game provides each user with 9 different emblem sets for different roles and some specialities. You own 2 common emblem sets at the beginning the Physical and Magic emblem, which are comparitively weaker to the attribute boosts given by the other emblems. The rest 7 emblem sets will be unlocked when your account reaches Lvl. 10. Each emblem set increases your power in some or the other way.
		</p>

		<p>Each emblem set has its own emblem level, Lvl. 1 at the beginning (up to Lvl. 60). Each upgrade requires some items(the particular Emblem fragments or Magic Dust) and BPs, and grant some attribute boosts.
		</p>

		<p>Each emblem talent branch will be unlocked, once each emblem reaches Lvl. 15. You own 1 talent points at the beginning and get 1 talent point every 5 levels. So you will be able to get all 7 talent points once it reaches Lvl. 45
		</p>

		<p>Each emblem talent has 3 tiers. The first 2 tiers provide basic attribute boosts, each talent of the first two tiers can be upgraded up to Lvl. 3. The last tier, however, provides much stronger effects. The first third tier talent unlocks at level 15 and can be equipped with one talent point.
		</p>

		<p>Rules of Unlocking Talents: The first tier has no limitations. You can upgrade them with talent points up to 3 talent points used in the first tier; The 2ne tier will be unlocked at level 30, when you use 3 talent points in the first tier. You can upgrade talents with talent points, up to 3 talent points; There is no limitation in the 3rd tier. However, each talent has its own unlock level and cannot be upgraded, i.e, only 1 talent point can be used in the 3rd tier.
		</p>

		<p>Each emblem set's talent points can be distributed and reset at will and that too for free. Reset button is beside the talent point count and when there are multiple talents unlocked, you can re-distribute the talent points by tapping the check button to change your talent in the 3rd tier, anytime.

		</p>

		<p>There are several talent pages for each emblem set beside talent points. The first page is for free while unlocking the others requires Starlight Membership or Tickets. Each talent page saves your current build. You can choose different emblem sets and talent pages while picking heroes.
