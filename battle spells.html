<body><h1>Battle Spells
		</h1>

		<p>Battle Spells are unique spells that you choose before the start of each game. Using the right Battle Spell can turn the battle in your favor.
		</p>

		<p>Battle Spells give your hero an advantage. Pick Battle Spells that compliment your hero, or make up for your heroâ€™s weakness. For example, Fighter role is know for going in and out in the battle so the best spell for it is a Flicker that helps you teleport in a distance in a split seconds. Assassins role is known for taking down enemy in a split second so execute suits best for assassins because iexecute can deal massive true damage in enemy.
		</p>
