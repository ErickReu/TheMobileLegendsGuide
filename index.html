		<h1>Mobile Legends Bang Bang</h1>
		<p>is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed and published by Moonton. Released in 2016, the game has become popular in Southeast Asia and was among the games chosen for the first medal event esports competition at the 2019 Southeast Asian Games in the Philippines</p>
	


      <h1>General</h1>
		<p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. The two opposing teams fight to reach and destroy the enemy's base while defending their own base for control of a path, the three "lanes" known as "top", "middle" and "bottom", which connects the bases. Weaker computer-controlled characters, called "minions", spawn at team bases and follow the three lanes to the opposite team's base, fighting enemies and turrets.</p>

		<p>In each team, there are five players who each control a character, known as a "hero" using analog/joystick controls. Heroes can be grouped into 6 different roles, Marksman, Assassin, Mage, Support, Fighter, and Tank.</p>

		





If you enjoy using magics to annoy or take down your opponent, picking a mage hero would suit you best.
